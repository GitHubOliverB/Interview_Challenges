    "## Random Number Generator - Sequence Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $R$ be a random number generator, such that $R\\left(n\\right)$ returns an integer in the range $0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ with uniform probability. Note that this is not a true function in the mathematical sense, as inputting the same number a second time will not necessarily yield the same result. The random number generator only works for $n > 1$. Starting from a googol, ie $x_{0} = 10^{100}$, consider the sequence $x_{i} = R\\left(x_{iâˆ’1}\\right)$. Eventually the sequence terminates when $x_{s} = 0$ for some $s$ and no further generation is possible. What is $\\mathbb{E}\\left[s\\right]$?"
