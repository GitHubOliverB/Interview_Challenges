    "If we break a stick once at a random spot $X$, we end up with two pieces of length $X$ and $1-X$.\n",
    "Given that the spot $X$ is a random variable following a uniform distribution, so $X\\sim U\\left(0,L\\right)$ and that the longest piece is of length $L_{\\text{max}} = \\max\\left(X, L-X\\right)$, we are able to find the expected length. As for $L_{\\text{max}}$, you may also write:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L_{\\text{max}} = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "L-X &\\text{$X < \\frac{L}{2}$} \\\\\n",

    "In our case, the probability density function $f_{U}$ must satisfy:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence $f_{U} = \\frac{1}{L}$ and from there we can work out the expected length of the longest piece after breaking the stick one time:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
